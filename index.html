                    Working in infosys since october 2019. During infosys training i have been trained on python, DBMS,
                    Java Springboot, HTML5, CSS3, ReactJs and Postman for API testing. I learned Get, Put, Post and
                    Delete request for Postman during training. After training i was assinged to a development project
                    where i updated the user stories for both front end, back end and handled the tickets raised by the
                    testers. <br> <br>
                    After completing the development work for the project i did testing also after recieving knowledge
                    training for the different functionalities in Oracle CCB. During testing i executed the test cases
                    successfully
                    where functionalities were working fine and log the bugs where the functionalities were not working
                    in AzureDevops. <br> <br>
                    Other then this i designed the test cases also according to the functionality requirement after
                    checking the functionality documents and attended the daily syncup calls with the whole team and
                    provide them with the work update on daily basis. <br><br>
                    While i was doing testing the development work was less so i started learning JavaScript own my own.
                    I created
                    some web pages also using it. When i was learning JavaScript i wanted to create my own website so i
                    created a repository on GitHub and deployed the code on Netlify to access it anywhere in the form of
                    website.
